# German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark

The German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark dataset provides a collection of images of traffic signs captured from roads in Germany. This dataset is designed for research in visual recognition, focusing on tasks such as object detection and semantic segmentation for autonomous driving systems. The goal of the dataset is to enable the development of autonomous vehicles that can recognize and interpret road signs with the same capability as humans.

## Dataset Overview

The dataset consists of images of 43 distinct traffic sign classes, each associated with a class ID and a corresponding label. The dataset is organized into three subsets: training, validation, and test.

### Key Information:

1. **Image Resolution**: 
   - Each image in the dataset has a resolution of 32 x 32 pixels.
   - The images are represented in RGB format with three color channels.
   - Pixel values are stored as unsigned 8-bit integers (ranging from 0 to 255).

2. **Number of Classes**: 
   - The dataset includes 43 unique classes of traffic signs, each representing a different road sign design or meaning.

3. **Training Set**:
   - Contains 34,799 images, each paired with a corresponding class label.

4. **Validation Set**:
   - Comprises 4,410 images, with labels corresponding to their respective traffic sign classes.

5. **Test Set**:
   - Contains 12,630 images, each labeled with the corresponding class.
 
### CSV File

The dataset also it includes a CSV file with two columns:

1. **ClassID**: Represents the class ID of the traffic sign (integer).
2. **SignName**: Represents the name of the traffic sign (string).

This CSV file provides a mapping between the class ID and the corresponding name of the traffic sign.

## Requirements

To work with the GTSRB dataset and create an autonomous driving model, the following tools and libraries are required:

- **Python**: The primary programming language for developing models using this dataset.
- **TensorFlow / Keras**: Deep learning frameworks for building and training neural networks.
- **NumPy**: Essential for handling array operations and numerical computations.
- **Seaborn**: Used for visualization of heatmaps and sub plots.
- **Matplotlib**: Used for visualizing images and training progress.
- **Pandas**: For handling and processing the CSV file containing class labels.
- **Pickle**: For serializing and deserializing Python objects, especially for loading preprocessed data.

To install the required dependencies, use the following command:

```bash
pip install tensorflow numpy matplotlib pandas pickle seaborn
